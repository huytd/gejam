RUST/HTML5 CANVAS GAME TEMPLATE
===============================

Making HTML5 Canvas games with Rust.

This is actually the *shameless* ripped off version of [Matthew Collins's Ludum Dare 38 submission](https://gitlab.com/Thinkofname/ld38).

For development, run:

    $ ./watch.sh

For building and publishing, run:

    $ ./build-wasm-release.sh

You need to add WASM build target for Rust as well.
